### Drillbook for the Dockyard Academy Curriculum

## Overview

This drillbook follows the same structure as the academy curriculum and is designed to be used in conjunction with it. 

## What is a drillbook? 
A collection of short exercises/drills designed to teach muscle memory and help with recall when it comes to concepts and syntax.

For instance if you've done the function section of the curriculum, you can then do function dills in the drillbook to build more muscle memory and help with remembering syntax.
